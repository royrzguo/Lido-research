# Lido at a Crossroads: From LSD Leader to Staking Infrastructure

Lido remains the largest player in Ethereum staking, but its leadership is facing clear challenges. While Ethereum’s overall staking ratio continues to rise, **Lido has not captured the new inflows** and has recently seen periods of net outflow. At the same time, **LDO has underperformed ETH sharply**, now trading at less than one-fifth of its initial relative value. Even though **stETH is still one of the most important base assets in DeFi**, competition from CEX staking and new LRT protocols is putting pressure on its position.

This leads us to three key questions:
1. **Can Lido sustain its dominance** in the staking market as competition intensifies?
2. **Will V3(stVaults) be enough to shift the current trend**, or will users continue to move to alternatives?
3. **Does LDO offer upside at today’s price**, given its stable but slowing core business?

**Investing view**: there is limited reason to buy LDO based on current fundamentals, but the **governance changes** under discussion and the **launch of V3** could act as meaningful catalysts that reshape its outlook and valuation.


## 1. How Did Lido Lose Momentum?  

### 1.1 Market Share at a Three-Year Low  
Lido’s share of staked ETH has **fallen to ~24.4%, its lowest point since 2022**. Importantly, this decline has occurred **despite the overall staking ratio on Ethereum continuing to climb**. The result is that Lido has consistently seen **net withdrawals**, indicating that while total staking demand is rising, **new inflows are increasingly bypassing Lido**. In effect, Ethereum staking is expanding, but Lido’s relative position is shrinking.

### 1.2 Why Lido Is Losing Share  
1) **Incentives that don’t attract new deposits.**  
   Lido’s Core Pool remains simple and low-friction, but its **base APY has steadily compressed** in line with network yields. The issue is not only lower rates—competitors face the same trend—but the **added layers of incentives from LRTs** (points, airdrops, restaking rewards), which have proven far more effective at pulling incremental capital in 2024–2025.

2) **CEXs capture mainstream flows.**  
   Platforms like **Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken** offer custodial staking with one click, a far easier entry point for new retail participants. As a result, much of the fresh staking demand flows directly to CEX solutions, bypassing Lido and other on-chain protocols.  

3) **A single, undifferentiated product.**  
   V2 (Core Pool) provides only one standardized risk/return option. For retail users, this means limited differentiation; for institutions, there is **no customizable entry**—such as validator selection, fee or MEV split preferences, or risk insurance. This lack of segmentation has left Lido less competitive, particularly as rivals experiment with more flexible structures.  

## 2. Lido’s Core Strengths (Why It’s Still #1)  

Despite competitive pressure, Lido continues to dominate Ethereum staking because of structural advantages that are difficult to displace:  

1) **stETH / wstETH as DeFi’s base layer.**  
   Lido’s liquid staking token is the **most widely integrated asset across DeFi**—used as collateral in lending protocols (Aave, Maker, Compound), traded with deep liquidity on DEXs (Curve, Uniswap), and embedded in derivatives platforms (GMX, Lyra, Pendle). This breadth creates a **network effect** that competitors cannot easily replicate.  

2) **Sticky institutional and whale users.**  
   Early adopters—including large DAOs (Aave, Curve, Maker) and funds—hold significant stETH allocations. For these players, **switching costs are high** due to collateral integrations, governance frameworks, and liquidity constraints. This “stickiness” stabilizes Lido’s base even as new inflows decline.  

3) **Proven reliability.**  
   Since launch, Lido has operated with **no major slashing events or security failures**, building confidence in its validator set and infrastructure. In staking—where principal security is paramount—this **track record is a competitive moat**.  

4) **Stable protocol economics.**  
   Lido charges a **10% fee on staking rewards**, shared between node operators and the DAO treasury. Despite shrinking market share, the **absolute ETH staked remains large**, ensuring the DAO continues to generate sustainable revenues that fund contributors, audits, and development.  


## 3. V3 and the Next Stage: From LSD → Infra  

Lido’s upcoming **V3 upgrade** represents more than a product iteration; it signals a **strategic repositioning** of the protocol from a single-product LSD leader to a broader **staking infrastructure platform**.  
<img width="800" height="450" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c325bd0b-72b9-473e-83c1-41231c70123b" />

1) **stVaults architecture.**  
   At the core of V3 are **modular vaults (“stVaults”)**, designed to allow flexible strategies: new validator sets, potential custom yield structures, and future integration with **EigenLayer restaking**. This modularity contrasts with today’s monolithic Core Pool and could expand Lido beyond ETH staking.  

2) **Platform shift.**  
   With V3, Lido is no longer only the **LSD market leader**. Instead, it evolves into an **infrastructure layer for staking**, enabling different products, validator configurations, and potentially multi-chain or restaking options. This positions Lido as a **platform for developers and institutions**, not just a staking service.  

3) **Competitive positioning.**  
   By entering the **staking infra race**, Lido moves into direct competition with **EigenLayer** (restaking), **Frax** (modular LSD + DeFi integration), and emerging **LRT protocols** (Swell, EtherFi, Renzo). If successful, Lido V3 could **defend its base while capturing new demand** from restaking and institutional clients.  

## 4. Tokenomics and Governance: Stable Today, Untapped Potential Ahead

### 4.1 Clear and Predictable Revenue Model
Lido charges a **10% fee on staking rewards**, split **50/50** between node operators and the Lido DAO treasury (i.e., ~5% of gross staking rewards accrue to the DAO). The fee can be changed only via a DAO vote. 

<img width="480" height="266" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1cb39be-3fef-4081-bb0d-9ab088956ea5" />

### 4.2 Financial profile: sustainable and profitable model
<img width="650" height="270" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4894cb69-d93e-42da-b780-e71129007bf3" />

Lido has moved beyond its early phase of heavy incentive spending and now operates with stable revenues and positive cash flow. The protocol consistently covers its operating expenses while maintaining strong market share in ETH staking. This financial resilience positions Lido as one of the few liquid staking protocols already running a sustainable and profitable model, strengthening its capacity for long-term ecosystem growth.

**ETH vs USD views**
- **ETH view** shows the true operating trend, driven by staked ETH, staking APR, and market share, without ETH/USD price noise.  
- **USD view** is useful for investor framing but largely reflects ETH price movements.

### 4.3 DAO Treasury – Well-Funded, Under-Leveraged
The DAO Treasury currently holds over 100 M LDO and significant ETH/stETH reserves, valued at an estimated $400–480 M depending on market conditions. Historically, treasury usage has been cautious and episodic:
- 2021 — Proposal to sell 100 M LDO to strategic partners like Paradigm in exchange for ETH, with gradual unlocks, to onboard long-term ecosystem allies.
- 2023 — Multiple motions to diversify holdings into stablecoins to secure multi-year operational runway.
- 2023 — Discussion to create a Treasury Management Committee to formalize spending policy.
- 2024–2025 — Revenue-sharing proposals (see 4.1) debated but not enacted.

To date, the treasury’s primary uses have been ecosystem grants, liquidity incentives, and operational costs, but without a recurring, structured capital deployment framework. The size of the treasury is a valuation anchor for LDO, but its economic impact on token holders remains unrealized.

### 4.4 Governance Innovation as a Future Catalyst
**(A) Dual governance (risk-mitigation / control alignment).**  
- Lido has advanced a **dual-governance** framework that gives **stETH holders** additional safeguards (e.g., **veto signaling / rage-quit-style** protections) alongside LDO governance—intended to align stakers and token holders and de-risk unilateral changes. Active work and LIP-28 discussions are public; a minor DG weakness disclosure in July 2025 notes a fix scheduled via on-chain voting.  

**(B) Value-accrual to LDO (buybacks / revenue sharing).**  
- **Today:** **LDO does not distribute cash** (no buybacks/dividends implemented).  
- **History / current debate:** There have been community proposals to **introduce LDO staking with protocol revenue sharing** and separate proposals for **dynamic LDO buybacks** funded by treasury inflows; these are **proposals under discussion**, not enacted policy. If adopted, such changes could **improve LDO’s payoff linkage** to protocol cash flows and act as a **valuation catalyst**. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

### 4.5 Relative Valuation: Why Infra Transition Matters

<img width="346" height="282" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1dd46f89-a997-41b3-8c1f-7475db724b21" />

<img width="680" height="282" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d323b74-ee3b-414d-9ebf-2afcf8fd6878" />


While Lido remains the largest liquid staking protocol by TVL, market valuations suggest room for rerating. For example, Ether.fi’s FDV ($1.1B) has approached Lido’s FDV ($1.4B) despite far smaller assets staked. Similarly, the liquid staking sector as a whole ($8.3B FDV) trades at much higher multiples relative to Lido’s share.

This gap underscores the market premium placed on “infrastructure” narratives (e.g., modular restaking, EigenLayer integration). If Lido successfully pivots from a pure LSD leader to a broader staking infrastructure platform (V3), its valuation multiple could expand significantly, aligning more with growth-oriented peers.


## 5. Risk Factors

Lido’s long-term success hinges on several critical uncertainties. Here are the primary risks to watch:

1) **Escalating Competition & Transformation Risk**
- **Competitive erosion** from LRT (e.g., Ether.fi, Swell) and CEX staking solutions. These alternatives offer boost returns or easier UX, which may continue to siphon incremental deposits from Lido.  
- **V3 execution risk**: The stVaults modular architecture must be delivered effectively. Any delays or underperformance could expose Lido to further market share loss and sentiment erosion.

2) **Regulatory Ambiguity & Legal Liability**
- The **SEC has recently clarified** that non-custodial liquid staking receipt tokens (e.g., stETH) *do not* constitute securities, providing crucial legitimacy to protocols like Lido.
- However, **regulatory uncertainty remains**. Key dissenters within the SEC have criticized the guidance, calling it vague and potentially reversible.
- Historic legal precedents also expose DAO tokenholders to potential liability: a US federal court recently ruled that **Lido DAO could be treated as a general partnership**, making its backers legally liable in securities-related claims.

3) **EU Regulation & MiCA Scope Gaps**
- The EU’s new **MiCA framework** does not yet address staking or DeFi primitives. Early iterations appear to limit innovation by excluding yield-bearing services.
- This may delay or restrict Lido’s access and adoption in European markets, especially for institutional or regulated end users.

## 6. Conclusion & Outlook  

**there is limited reason to buy LDO based on current fundamentals**, but the **governance reforms under discussion** and the **upcoming V3 launch** could prove to be meaningful catalysts that reshape both protocol dynamics and token valuation.  

Going forward, investors should pay particular attention to:  
- **Adoption and execution of V3 (stVaults):** whether Lido can reposition itself from a single-product LSD leader to a broader staking infrastructure platform.  
- **Governance and tokenomics changes:** concrete progress on value-accrual mechanisms (e.g., revenue sharing, buybacks) that could enhance LDO’s linkage to protocol success.  
- **Competitive pressure from CEXs and LRTs:** whether Lido can stabilize or regain market share amid intensifying alternatives.  
- **Regulatory clarity:** how evolving SEC and EU guidance on staking will affect institutional participation and Lido DAO liability.  

**Bottom line:** Lido is at a crossroads—its core remains strong, but its future valuation hinges on **successful infra transition and governance evolution**. These will determine whether LDO continues to drift as a utility token or re-rates as a true staking infrastructure play.
